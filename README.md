# **Underage Slot Machines Simulator** 🎰👶  
*Teaching kids the joys of financial ruin before they're even old enough to vote!*  


## **About**  
Welcome to **Underage Slot Machines Simulator**—the only slot machine designed to crush kids’ dreams and allowances while imparting life lessons about the horrors of gambling. Through *rigged outcomes* and *sketchy user interfaces,* this app ensures that young players quickly learn: **“99% OF GAMBLERS QUIT RIGHT BEFORE THEY WIN BIG!!.”**

## **Features**  

- 🎨 **Sketchy UI**  
  Experience the thrill of weird colors, outdated buttons, and loading spinners that *never* stop spinning—just like a real back-alley casino. Includes a flashy button pop-up for adults who try to gamble on the website.

- 🎵 **Subtle Casino Music**  
  A seamless loop of generic slot machine jingles, faint enough to get stuck in your head forever. For the *true* casino vibe, volume controls are purposely broken.

- 😄 **Custom Symbols: Friendship Edition**  
  Spin the reels and match the faces of your *real-life friends* (aka the Ascend organizers) instead of boring old cherries and bells. Losing money has never been so… *personal.*

- 🎉 Confetti Explosions
Every “win” triggers an unholy cascade of confetti & flashy animations. Perfect for a temporary dopamine rush that hooks players and leaves them spinning again… and again.
